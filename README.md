# Flutter Clock

For the Flutter Clock Challenge 2020, I wanted to build a clean but functional clock. As this is my first Flutter project, I wanted to try out as many features as I can but not in such a way to make the clock messy. I asked for the help of a designer at my company to keep the style clean whilst providing the below features.

### Core Features
- Clean and Comfortable Design
- Both Analog & Digital Clock
- Light / Dark Mode
- Weather icons
- Show Date

### Cool Features
- See Rain at a glance - minimal but soothing ripple effect for Raining & Thunderstorm
- Talkback enabled for Accessibility
